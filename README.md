# Frontend Admin Dashboard for User Management (React + Redux)

In response to the growing need for streamlined administrative processes,this project is a development of a modern and efficient frontend admin dashboard built for managing users at a startup. Utilizing React with Vite as the framework, and other cutting-edge technologies including Redux Toolkit, React-Bootstrap, React Icons, and React-Toastify, this project delivers a smooth and responsive user experience.

## üîê Key Features:

User List: A clean and informative table displays user information, including ID, name, email, and any other relevant fields. Column titles are visually distinct from entries for clarity.
Powerful Search and Filtering: A search bar allows filtering users based on any property, leveraging React's powerful search capabilities. The user list and pagination dynamically update based on search results.
In-place Editing and Deletion: Edits and deletions are conveniently handled directly within the table rows, utilizing state management features of Redux Toolkit and React-Redux. These changes are reflected in the current user list without requiring database persistence.
Pagination with User-Friendly Navigation: Users can easily navigate through pages of data using intuitive buttons for first, previous, next, and last page. Pagination dynamically adapts to search results, ensuring an efficient user experience.
User Selection and Batch Delete: Individual or bulk selection of users is facilitated with checkboxes and a dedicated "Delete Selected" button. This simplifies user management tasks for admins.
Accessibility and Usability Focus: The interface incorporates React Bootstrap for accessible design, ensuring proper keyboard navigation and visual cues for selected rows.
