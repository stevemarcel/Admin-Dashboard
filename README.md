# Frontend Admin Dashboard for User Management (React + Redux)

In response to the growing need for streamlined administrative processes,this project is a development of a modern and efficient frontend admin dashboard built for managing users at a startup. Utilizing React with Vite as the framework, and other cutting-edge technologies including Redux Toolkit, React-Bootstrap, React Icons, and React-Toastify, this project delivers a smooth and responsive user experience.

## 🔐 Key Features:

- **User List:** A clean and informative table displays user information, including ID, name, email, and any other relevant fields. Column titles are visually distinct from entries for clarity.
- **Powerful Search and Filtering:** A search bar allows filtering users based on any property, leveraging React's powerful search capabilities. The user list and pagination dynamically update based on search results.
- **In-place Editing and Deletion:** Edits and deletions are conveniently handled directly within the table rows, utilizing state management features of Redux Toolkit and React-Redux. These changes are reflected in the current user list without requiring database persistence.
- **Pagination with User-Friendly Navigation:** Users can easily navigate through pages of data using intuitive buttons for first, previous, next, and last page. Pagination dynamically adapts to search results, ensuring an efficient user experience.
- **User Selection and Batch Delete:** Individual or bulk selection of users is facilitated with checkboxes and a dedicated "Delete Selected" button. This simplifies user management tasks for admins.
- **Accessibility and Usability Focus:** The interface incorporates React Bootstrap for accessible design, ensuring proper keyboard navigation and visual cues for selected rows.
